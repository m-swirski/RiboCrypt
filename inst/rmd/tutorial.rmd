# Introduction

Welcome to `RiboCrypt`

`RiboCrypt` is an R package and web server for interactive visualization
and analysis in genomics. `RiboCrypt` works with most NGS-based methods,
but much emphasis is put on Ribo-seq data visualization. RiboCrypt uses
ORFik experiment objects, so to ensure compatibility use
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04254-w" target="_blank">ORFik</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rc-biotech/massiveNGSpipe" target="_blank">massiveNGSpipe</a>
for processing own (unpublished) data. If you encounter any issues,
please, contact us using the info in the footnote.

The following is web server walk through listing all utilities and
options therein.

## Ribo-seq overview

For more general material about ribosome profiling, we suggest reading
<a href="https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/11/5/a032698.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">this
review</a>. For more technical explanation of data processing steps and
specific analyses, it's best to see

# Browser {#browser}

The browser is the basic coverage display page. It contains a selection
panel on the left side and a display window (browser) on the right. It
displays coverage of sequencing data in either transcript coordinates
(default, collapsed introns), or genomic coordinates. The following
(Fig. 1), SRD5A1 gene,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5390104/v1" target="_blank">has
recently been shown to be decoded in three frames</a>.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px", out.height="600px", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tutorial_fig1.png")
```

Figure 1. SRD5A1 gene displayed using default options. Using
[API](#API), this browser view can be re-generated using this
[link](https://ribocrypt.org/?&dff=all_merged-Homo_sapiens_modalities&gene=SRD5A1-ENSG00000145545&tx=ENST00000274192&library=RFP&frames_type=area&kmer=9&log_scale=FALSE&extendLeaders=0&extendTrailers=0&viewMode=FALSE&other_tx=FALSE&add_uorfs=FALSE&genomic_region=&customSequence=&phyloP=FALSE&summary_track=FALSE&go=TRUE).

## Browser window

When you press the "plot" button on the selection panel, the selected
data will be displayed according to specified options, explained later
in the tutorial.

The browser window consists of the specific parts:

1.  Single or multiple density tracks are displayed on top. By default
    Ribo-seq is rendered in 3 colors, where

-   red is 0 frame, the start frame of reference transcript.
-   green is +1 frame
-   blue is +2 frame

2.  Sequence track (top middle), displayes DNA sequence when zoomed in
    (\< 100nt)
3.  Annotation track (middle), the annotation track displays the
    transcript annotation, together with black bars that is displayed on
    top of the data track. CDS and other annotations are color-coded
    according to relative reading frame
4.  Frame track (bottom), the 3 frames displayed with given color bars:

-   white (start codon, ATG)

-   black (stop codons, TAA \| TAG \| TGA)

-   brown (custom motifs, e.g. NTG all start codon alternatives)

    When zoomed in, the amino acid sequence is displayed within each
    frame.

5.  Additional displays, for example protein structure viewer, which
    appears after clicking on isoform ID on annotation track.

In the example above (Fig. 1), notice green coverage preceding CDS (in
Blue). It corresponds to overlapping open reading frame, so it is clear
that there are two regions that undergo translation simultaneously in
this locus.

## Selection panel (browser)

The display panel shows the primary settings, (study, gene, sample,
etc):

### Experiment {#exp}

-   Select an organism: Either select "ALL" to keep all experiments, or
    select a specific organism to select display only that subset of
    experiments in experiment select tab.
-   Select an experiment: The experiments contain study names combined
    with organism (some studies are multi species, so sometimes one
    study have multiple experiments). Select which one you want. There
    also exist merged experiments (all samples merged for the organism,
    etc). RNA-seq experiments have an addition "_RNA" as suffix.

### Gene {#gene}

-   Select a gene: A gene can be selected using:
    -   Gene id (ENSEMBL)
    -   Gene symbol (HGNC, etc)
-   Select a transcript: A transcript isoform of the given gene above,
    default is Ensembl canonical isoform, other isoforms can be
    selected.

### Library {#lib}

Usually each experiment have multiple libraries. In the case of merged
experiments, different modalities (RFP, RNA, disome, TI, see Fig. 2) can
be selected in this field. Select which one to display, if you select
multiple libraries they will be stacked in the browser as multiple
tracks.

Library are by default named:

-   Library type (RFP, RNA etc),
-   Condition (WT, KO (wild type, knock out ) etc)
-   Stage/timepoint (5h, 1d (5 hours, 1 day) etc)
-   fraction (chx, cytosolic, ATF4 (ribosomal inhibitor, cell fraction,
    gene) etc)
-   replicate (technical/biological replicate number (r1, r2, r3))

The resuting name could for example be:

-   RFP_WT_5h_chx_cytosolic_r1

It's normal to see that if condition is KO (knockout), the fraction
column contains a gene name (the name of the gene that was knocked out).
Currently the best way to find SRR run number for respective sample is
to go to metadata tab and search for the study.

### Display type {#linetype}

-   Select reading frames display type:
    -   lines (single line per frame, most clear for middle distance (\>
        100 nt))
    -   columns (single bars per position, most clear for single
        nucleotide resolution)
    -   stacks (Area under curve, stacked, most clear for large regions
        (\> 1000 nt))
    -   area (Area under curve, with semitransparent overlapping frames,
        most clear for large regions (\> 1000 nt))
    -   heatmap (good for displaying large number of libraries, see
        metabrowser for display of thousands of libraries)
-   K-mer length: sliding window of selected length applying averaging
    coverage per frame. K-mer = 1 means unaltered data. When looking at
    a large region (\> 100nt), pure coverage can usually be hard to
    inspect due to intrinsic Ribo-seq spikyness. Using K-mer length \> 1
    (9, the default, is a good starting point), you can easily look at
    patterns over larger regions.

Notice, how in figure 2 reducing K-mer length to 1, changing display
type to columns and adding TI-seq (Translation Initiation profiling,
samples treated with translation initiation inhibitors - either
lactimidomycin or harringtonin) enables detection of translation in all
three reading frames. In fact, experienced user can notice drop of
signal in red frame after stop codon of the corresponding ORF (hidden
behind most abundant, green), further corroborating overlapping
translation. If this process seems somewhat imprecise and not fully
defined - it is by design - annotating such elusive phenomena is
notoriously difficult to tackle algorithmically, and doing so
successfully requires deep intuition in how the signal and noise behave,
so manual investigation into many instances like this. Thus, RiboCrypt
can be treated as a hypothesis building tool, rather a database of fixed
answers.

## Selection panel (Settings) {#settings}

Settings tab contains additional parameters:

-   5' extension (extend viewed window upstream)
-   3' extension (extend viewed window downstream)
-   Custom sequences highlight (Motif search, given in brown color,
    support IUPAC, examples: CTG or NTG)
-   Genomic region (Browse genomic window instead of gene, syntax:
    chromosome:start-stop:strand, human/mouse/zebrafish: 1:10000-20000:+
    , yeast: I:10000-20000:+. Both 1 and chr1 works, conversion will be
    done automatically)
-   Zoom interval (start with a zoom and highlight on a subsection):
    Either specified in tx/view coordinates, i.e. 20:50 will give zoom 
    on region (20-10):(50+10) = 10:60, and a highlight color (light yellow)
    at coordinates 20:50. You can also specify in genomic coordinates as above
    for genomic region (remember the genomic coordinates must then be within
    the gene / region you are displaying).
-   Genomic View (Activate/deactivate genomic view, displaying full
    introns, see Figure 3)
-   Full annotation (display all transcript isoforms annotation or just
    the selected isoform)
-   uORF annotation (display candidate uORFs in the annotation track) this is not the
    predicted set, but all possible uORFs by seqnece. For predicted set, check 
    the predicted translons checkbox.
-   Predicted translons - display [predicted translons](#translons) in
    the annotation track. Try turning it on for the
    [example](https://ribocrypt.org/?&dff=all_merged-Homo_sapiens_modalities&gene=SRD5A1-ENSG00000145545&tx=ENST00000274192&library=RFP&frames_type=area&kmer=9&log_scale=FALSE&extendLeaders=0&extendTrailers=0&viewMode=FALSE&other_tx=FALSE&add_uorfs=FALSE&genomic_region=&customSequence=&phyloP=FALSE&summary_track=FALSE&go=TRUE)
    in Figures 1 and 2 - notice that the red (second) translon was
    missed
-   Log scale (Log scale the coverage, reduces effect of extreme peaks)

-   Protein structures (If you click the annotation name of a transcript
    in the plot panel it will display the alpha-fold protein colored by
    the ribo-seq data displayed in the plot panel)
-   PhyloP (PhyloP conservation track will be added on the bottom)
-   Split color frame (Split riboseq signal into colors by frame) 
    i.e. red, green and blue. If this is on, then Ribo-seq and 
    Ti-seq will be displayed with colors split by frame.
-   Frames subset (If split color frame is TRUE, 
    you can display only wanted color)
-   Summary top track (Add an additional plot track on top, summarizing
    all selected libraries)
-   Select Summary display type (same as frames display type above, but
    for the summary track)
-   Export format (Choose plot export format from plotly controls. The
    default is svg vector graphics that allows for high customizability)
-   Plot (red button, render selected gene/region as plotly html, 
    with specified settings)

Uniquely, RiboCrypt allows for toggling between transcriptomic and
genomic views, while displaying coding exons in colors according to the
correct reading frame. Moreover, extensions allow for exploration of
large chunks of the genome, even tens of thousands of bases.

finding all genes in this browser window, and then turn full annotation
on to see what you missed! (loading may be a bit slow, but displaying
over region 30 thousands bases long here isn't practical)

genes.

## 

# Mega Browser {#mbrowser}

Display all samples for a specific organism over selected gene (Fig. 5).
This tab does not use bigwig files to load (as that would be very slow).
It uses precomputed fst files of coverage over all libraries. Note: Not
all isoforms are computed, by default the longest isoform is computed.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px", out.height="500px", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tutorial_fig5.png")
```

Figure 5. Heatmap of thousands of libraries coverage over ATF4
transcript. Clustered using k-means = 2, with summary track displayed on
top.

## Selection panel (Browser)

Organism, experiment and gene explained above

-   Group on: the metadata column to order plot by
-   K-means clusters: How many k-means clusters to use, if \> 1, Group
    will be sorted within the clusters, but K-means have priority.

## Selection panel (Settings)

-   Normalization (all scores are tpm normalized and log scaled)
    -   transcriptNormalized (each sample counts sum to 1) (default)
    -   Max normalized (each position count divided by maximum)
    -   zscore (zscore normalization, (count \* mean / sd) variance
        scaled normalization)
    -   tpm (raw tpm of counts, is very sensitive to extreme peaks)
-   Color theme: Which color theme to use
-   Color scale multiplier: how much to amplify the color signal (if all
    is single color, try to reduce or increase this depending on which
    color is the majority)
-   Sort by other gene: Sort heatmap on expression of another gene
    (increasing). A line plot will be shown left that display the
    expression of that other gene per row. Also the enrichment analysis
    is done on bins of the other genes expression instead of metadata
    term.
-   Summary top track (same as in browser, the aggregate of all rows,
    useful to see the frame information, which is not represented in the
    heatmap)
-   Split by frame: (Not active yet!): When completed will display the
    heatmap with frame information, so rgb colors from white to dark red
    etc.
-   Summary display type: Same as in browser
-   Region to view: By default uses entire transcript. Can subset to
    only view cds or leader+cds etc.
-   Select a transcript: Which transcript isoforms not all isoforms have
    computed fsts. By default the longest isoforms have been computed
    for all genes.
-   K-mer length: Smoothens out the signal by applying a mean sliding
    window, default 1 (off)

## Statistics tab

This tab gives the statistics of over representation analysis per
cluster of the metabrowser plot. Using chi squared test, it gives the
residuals per term from metadata (like tissue, cell-line etc). If a
value is bigger than +/- 3, it means it is quite certain this is over
represented. This is shown as a red line.

If no clustering was applied, this tab gives the number of items per
metadata term (40 brain samples, 30 kidney samples etc).

## Requirements

This mode is very intensive on CPU, so it requires certain pre-computed
results for the back end. That is namely: - Premade collection
experiments (an ORFik experiment of all experiments per organism) -
Premade collection count table and library sizes (for normalizations
purpose) - Premade fst serialized coverage calculation per gene (for
instant loading of coverage over thousands of libraries)

Note that on the live app, the human collection (4000 Ribo-seq samples)
takes around 30 seconds to plot for a \~ 2K nucleotides gene, \~99% of
the time is spent on rendering the plot, not actual computation. Future
investigation into optimization will be done.

# Analysis

Here we collect the analysis possibilities, which are usually operating
on meta-gene or multi locus scale.

## Heatmap {#heatmap}

This tab displays a heatmap of coverage per readlength at a specific
region (like start site of coding sequences) over all genes selected.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px", out.height="500px", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tutorial_fig4.png")
```

Figure 4. Metagene per-readlength heatmap of before (upper panel) and
after (bottom panel) P-shifting. Notice emerging periodicity.

### Selection panel (heatmap)

Study and gene select works same as for browser specified above. In
addition to have the option to specify all genes (default).

-   Select libraries. Currently Only 1 library can be selected in
    heatmap mode.
-   View region Select one of:
    -   Start codon
    -   Stop codon
-   Normalization Normalization mode for data display, select one of:
    -   transcriptNormalized (each gene counts sum to 1)
    -   zscore (zscore normalization, will give better overview if 1
        readlength is extreme)
    -   sum (raw sum of counts, is very sensitive to extreme peaks)
    -   log10sum (log10 sum of counts, is less sensitive to extreme
        peaks)
-   Min Readlength The minimum readlength to display
-   Max readlength The maximum readlength to display

### Selection panel (settings)

Here additional options are shown:

-   5' extension (extend viewed window upstream from point, default 30)

-   3' extension (extend viewed window downstreamfrom point, default 30)

-   Summary top track - summarized coverage from all readlengths

-   p-shifted - display either P-sites (default), or reads 5' ends.

Metagene analysis with heatmap module can be used, for example, to
investigate how well P-site positioning was performed (Fig. 4)

## Codon analysis

This tab displays a heatmap of codons dwell times over all genes
selected, for both A and P sites. When pressing "Differential" you swap
to a between library differential codon dwell time comparison (minimum 2
libraries selected is required for this method!)

### Display panel (codon)

Study and gene select works same as for browser specified above. In
addition to have the option to specify all genes (default).

-   Select libraries (multiple allowed)

#### Filters {#codonfilt}

-   Codon filter value (Minimum reads in ORF to be included)
-   Codon score, all scores are normalized for both codon and count per
    gene level (except for sum):
    -   percentage (percentage use relative to max codon, transcript
        normalized percentages)
    -   dispersion(NB) (negative binomial dispersion values)
    -   alpha(DMN) (Dirichlet-multinomial distribution alpha parameter)
    -   sum (raw sum, (a very biased estimator, since some codons are
        used much more than others!))

#### Codon plot

Display is the score per codon (amino acid), in addition there are 2
custom "amino acids", \* as in \* : TGA, means TGA is a stop codon (last
codon in CDS). Similar is #, as in \# : ATG which means ATG as start
codon (first codon in CDS). For P-sites start codons should be enriched,
while for A-sites there should be a richer variability, often with a
small enrichment for stop-codons. We will implement a richer model
eventually using the more correct negative binomial relationships
between E, P and A sites, i.g. the motif PPP (triplet-proline in E,P,A
site) is much stronger than a single P in the A site etc. alone etc.

## 

## Differential gene expression {#diffexp}

Given an experiment with a least 1 design column with two values, like
wild-type (WT) vs knock out (of a specific gene), you can run
differential expression of genes. The output is an interactive plot,
where you can also search for you target genes, making it more useable
than normal expression plots, which often are very hard to read.

### Selection panel (Differential expression)

Organism and experiment explained above - Differential method: FPKM
ratio is a pure FPKM ratio calculation without factor normalization
(like batch effects), fast and crude check. DESeq2 argument gives a
robust version, but only works for experiments with valid experimental
design (i.e. design matrix must be full ranked, see deseq2 tutorial for
details!) - Select two conditions (which 2 factors to group by)

### Selection panel (settings)

-   draw unregulated (show dots for unregulated genes, makes it much
    slower!)
-   Full annotation (all transcript isoforms, default is primary isoform
    only!)
-   P-value (sliding bar for p-value cutoff, default 0.05)
-   export format for plot (explained above)


## Read length (QC)

This tab displays a QC of pshifted coverage per readlength (like start
site of coding sequences) over all genes selected.

### Display panel (Read length QC)

The display panel shows what can be specified to display, the possible
select boxes are same as for heatmap above:

### Plot panel

From the options specified in the display panel, when you press "plot"
the data will be displayed. It contains the specific parts:

Top plot: Read length relative usage

1.  Y-axis: Score
2.  Color: Per frame (red, green, blue)
3.  Facet box: the read length

Bottom plot: Fourier transform (3 nucleotide periodicity quality, clean
peak means good periodicity)

## Fastq (QC)

This tab displays the fastq QC output from fastp, as a html page.

### Display panel (Read length QC)

The display panel shows what can be specified to display, you can select
from organism, study and library.

### Plot panel

Displays the html page.

# Metadata

Metadata tab displays information about studies and custom predictions.
RiboCrypt is integrated with
<a href="https://rdp.ucc.ie/home" target="_blank">Ribo-seq Data
Portal</a>, refer to
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae1020" target="_blank">this
paper</a> for details on metadata curation and standardization.

\## SRA search

Search SRA for full information of supported study

### Study accession number

Here you input a study accession number in the form of either:

-   SRP
-   GEO (GSE)
-   PRJNA (PRJ....)
-   PRJID (Only numbers)

### Output

On top the abstract of the study is displayed, and on bottom a table of
all metadata found from the study is displayed.

## Studies

Full table of supported studies with information about sample counts

## Predicted translons {#translon}

Full list of predicted translons on all_merged tracks per species.
Each translons has a link that directs you to the browser tab
and displays the transcript zoomed in on the translons with
a light yellow highlighting of the region.

### Settings:

Translon annotation scheme:

-   Prediction algorithm: ORFik::detect_ribo_orfs
-   translon_types \<- c("uORF", "uoORF","doORF","dORF")
-   start_codons \<- "ATG\|TTG\|CTG"
-   additional arguments: add sequence and amino acid sequence per
    translon
-   All other arguments default.

# Additional information

All files are packed into ORFik experiments for easy access through the
ORFik backend package:

File formats used internally in experiments are:

-   Annotation (gtf + TxDb for random access)
-   Fasta genome (.fasta, + index for random access)
-   Sequencing libraries (all duplicated reads are collapsed)
    -   random access (only for collapsed read lengths): bigwig
    -   Full genome coverage (only for collapsed read lengths): covRLE
    -   Full genome coverage (split by read lengths): covRLElist
-   count Tables (Summarized experiments, r data serialized .rds)
-   Library size list (Integer vector, .rds)
-   Precomputed gene coverages per organism: fst (used for metabrowser)

## massiveNGSpipe

For our webpage the processing pipeline used is
<a href="https://github.com/rc-biotech/massiveNGSpipe" target="_blank">massiveNGSpipe</a>
which wraps multiple tools:

1.  Fastq files are download with ORFik download.sra
2.  Adapter is detected with either fastqc (sequence detection) and
    falls back to fastp auto detection.
3.  Reads are then trimmed with fastp (using the wrapper in ORFik)

-   Adapter removal specified
-   minimum read size (20nt)

4.  Read are collapsed (get the set of unique reads and put duplication
    count in read header)
5.  Reads are aligned with the STAR aligner (using the wrapper in
    ORFik), that supports contamination removal. Settings:

-   genomic coordinates (to allow both genomic and transcriptomic
    coordinates)
-   local alignment (to remove unknown flank effects)
-   minimum read size (20nt)

6.  When all samples of study are aligned, an ORFik experiment is
    created that connects each sample to metadata (condition, inhibitor,
    fraction, replicate etc)
7.  Bam files are then converted to ORFik ofst format
8.  These ofst files are then pshifted
9.  Faster formats are then created (bigwig, fst and covRLE) for faster
    visualization

## API for URL access and sharing

RiboCrypt uses the shiny router API system for creating runable links
and backspacing etc. The API specificiation is the following:

### Primary url:

<https://ribocrypt.org/> (This leads to browser page)

### Page selection API:

Page selection is done with "\#" followed by the page short name, the
list is the following:

-   broser page (/ or /#browser)
-   MegaBrowser (/#MegaBrowser)
-   heatmap (/#heatmap)
-   codon (/#codon)
-   Differential expression (/#Differential expression)
-   Periodicity plot (/#periodicity)
-   fastq QC report (/#fastq)
-   SRA search (/#SRA search)
-   Studies supported (/#Studies)

page

### Parameter API: {#API}

Settings can be specified by using the standard web parameter API:

-   "?", Starts the parameter specification
-   "&", to combine terms:

Example:
<https://RiboCrypt.org/?dff=all_merged-Homo_sapiens&gene=ATF4-ENSG00000128272#browser>
will lead you to browser and insert gene ATF4 (all other settings being
default).

A more complicated call would be:
